Recently, the Bailiff of Brycliffe has been stomping about the perimeters of the Brycliffe estate, demonstrating its boundaries for all to see.

The Lord of Brycliffe has, of course, the right to set his Bailiff to establish the perimiters of his lands. What he does not have the right to do is to stamp and stomp on the common lands, proclaiming them as his own.

This will not do. Not at all. The common lands belong to everyone - not to the Manor of Brycliffe.

And surely, if the common land should belong to a Manor, they should belong to [[the much superior Manor of Baston?]]<!--/defang_tw-passagedata--><!--defang_tw-passagedata defang_pid="3" defang_name="the much superior Manor of Baston?" defang_tags="" defang_position="339,441.5" defang_size="100,100"-->And so here you are - the Bailiff of Baston, set by your Lord to establish the perimeters of the Manor, to remind the Bailiff of Briarclyff what&#39;s what.

You can&#39;t stop and smell the flowers in Berdescroft, as there aren&#39;t any. You can either:

There&#39;s not much to see here. If you were to visit in summer, the heather would be gently purple, and bees would be flitting in and out. It&#39;s much too early for that, so it&#39;s a little drab to look at - dark heather with lighter bracken poking through.

A songthrush lands on a nearby birch tree.

There&#39;s no point lingering here. This land has never been claimed for farming as the drainage is so poor, and the soil isn&#39;t at all fertile. The Lord of Brycliffe&#39;s man won&#39;t try to stomp his ownership here.

It’s lucky you’re such a conscientious man, always on top of your shoe repairs. There’ll be no wet feet today!

Visiting this corner of le Redon always brings your blood pressure a little lower. As you hear the wind moving the reeds you breathe out a little of your rage at the Bailiff of Brycliffe. The reed warblers actually remind you of him a little bit. Lots of noise pumps out of those pompous bodies, but they rarely dare stick their heads above the reeds.

You’re glad to see there’s no-one else here - you’ll be able to walk your way round le Redon much quicker if you don’t have to deal with either [[Roger Litilgrom]] or Thomas Bedyll.

Roger holds these four acres of le Redon which are thick with reeds. He’s a bit of a jonny-come-lately. Before him, this bit of land was held by at least two generations of the Roberdes family and they had their way of doing things. Thomas isn’t keen on this change in the status quo.

Thomas has held twenty acres of le Redon for at least ten years. His portion isn’t wetland - hard work has made it firm and dry. And he’s constantly guarding his borders from Roger’s seeping water and creeping reed.

You can sympathise. After all, you understand the need to protect the boundaries of land. But he doesn’t half go on.

You notice that Roger’s reeds have started to trespass into Thomas’ portion. 

Are you going to [[mention it]]?
Or are you going to [[choose a bit of peace and quiet]]?
